This project is for people who hesitate to type and read messages with GSM-based projects. Using GSM Smart Home app, the user does not need to type or read messages all things are automated. This app simply manage your project with a single click. I describe how this app is configured with GSM-based projects. In this project, I used Arduino language. You can also use any other language. To help you get started with the GSM Smart Home app, I include an example GSM based home control project with four devices and four sensors at the last step. This example demonstrates how easily the app integrates with your GSM-based projects, offering a hands-on guide to managing devices and sensors.
